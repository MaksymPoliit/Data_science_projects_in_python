# data-science-projects-in-python
In this repository are presented my very first projects, that shows my skills in data science coding using Python. 
The three projects are following:
1. Hockey project 
2. Movies project
3. Titanic Project

Primary task for Hockey project is to make a schedule of upcomming hockey matches, by perfoming web scraping on hockey team's website and cross-referencing it to following conditions:
1. Home matches only
2. Fridays only
Data must be cleaned from past matches and missing values. Results have to be saved in excell file

Movies project was made to perform the analysis using the Exploratory Data Analysis technique, as the result features affecting the ratings of any particular movie was found and a model predicting the movie ratings was built.

Main task in titanic project was to build a model predicting surviving of Titanic's passengers, which was based on Titanic dataset.
